- Add lightweight validation tests that ensure every agent's declared tools exist in the registry and that schemas remain OpenAI compliant.
- Wire a tiny CLI (`python -m agents.platform.cli`) to explore crews, run simulations, and export payloads for quick smoke tests.
- Attach Storybook-like snapshots for the CrewAI Mirror page to catch visual regressions and document component tokens.
