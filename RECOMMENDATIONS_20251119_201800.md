- Automate validation: add a pre-commit hook or CI job that checks control files for required sections (timestamps, sign-offs) and ensures `journal.md` is append-only.
- Create templates: supply markdown templates for new tasks and journal entries to reduce variance across agents.
- Monitoring: add a lightweight script to remind agents of the active task at shell prompt, reinforcing the anti-drift rule.
