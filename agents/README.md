# AI Agent Operations Framework

This directory contains the comprehensive operational framework for AI agents working in the kingdom-monorepo.

## 🚀 Quick Start for Agents

**New Agent?** Start here:
1. Read `agents.md` (master control document) - START HERE! 👈
2. Read `rules.md` (comprehensive operational rules)
3. Review `tasks.md` (current work queue)
4. Make your first journal entry in `journal.md`

## 📚 Core Documents

### Operational Documents
- **`agents.md`** - Master control document with onboarding, procedures, and guidelines (READ THIS FIRST!)
- **`rules.md`** - Comprehensive operational rules covering all aspects of agent work
- **`journal.md`** - Append-only activity log (all agent actions logged here)
- **`README.md`** - This file (quick reference)

### Strategic Documents (Balance Sheet View - "Where We Want to Be")
- **`srs.md`** - Software Requirements Specification (50+ requirements)
- **`features.md`** - Feature tracking (20 framework features)

### Tactical Documents (Income Statement View - "How We Get There")
- **`tasks.md`** - Task tracking with microgoals and test criteria
- **`project_summary.md`** - Executive summary bridging strategy and tactics

## 🎯 Key Principles

1. **State your task** before starting work
2. **Log everything** to journal.md with reasoning
3. **Focus on the task** - avoid drift
4. **Test before completing** - no task is done without proof
5. **Backup frequently** - commit to git regularly
6. **Update tasks.md** continuously
7. **journal.md is append-only** - never edit existing entries
8. **Log all communications** with other agents
9. **Sign off with timestamp** on all completed work
10. **Escalate blockers** within 30 minutes
