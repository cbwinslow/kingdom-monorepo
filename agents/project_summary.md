This summary captures the high-level intent of the agent operations starter kit and links it to broader product vision documents.

- **Purpose:** Provide a reusable bundle of operating rules, task management practices, and logging expectations for AI agents starting new projects.
- **Alignment:**
  - **features.md** — Expected capabilities and feature roadmap. Keep this summary synchronized with feature priorities.
  - **srs.md** — System requirements baseline. Ensure operating rules support the reliability, auditability, and compliance needs described there.
- **Operational Documents:**
  - **rules.md** — Defines execution constraints, communication, and testing norms.
  - **tasks.md** — Tracks actionable work with microgoals, tests, and sign-offs.
  - **journal.md** — Chronological ledger of reasoning, communications, and test evidence (append-only).
  - **agents.md** — Onboarding and process guidance referencing all control files.
- **Audit Expectations:** All updates to control files must include timestamps, responsible agent identification, and git commits for durability.

Use this document to maintain a cohesive picture of where the agent operations framework is headed and to ensure tactical tasks roll up to the intended strategic posture.
