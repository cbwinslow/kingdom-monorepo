## Task 1: Establish Agent Operations Starter Kit
- **Status:** In progress
- **Owner:** AI Agent (ChatGPT)
- **Created:** 2025-11-19 20:18 UTC
- **Description:** Create comprehensive operational rules and guidance for AI agents, including task management, journaling, and testing expectations.
- **Microgoals & Criteria:**
  1. Draft **agents.md** describing how to use control files and prevent task drift. _Criteria:_ File exists with instructions for rules, tasks, journal usage; timestamped and signed.
  2. Draft **rules.md** outlining operating constraints (logging, communication, permissions, updates). _Criteria:_ File exists with sections on drift, logging, communications, testing; timestamped and signed.
  3. Draft **tasks.md** with measurable template and starter task. _Criteria:_ Contains this entry plus guidance for future tasks; includes microgoals and test plans.
  4. Align with project context docs (**project_summary.md**, **features.md**, **srs.md**) by referencing them in control files. _Criteria:_ Control files instruct agents to keep alignment and note updates.
- **Required Tests & Evidence:**
  - Documentation verification: manual review of **agents.md**, **rules.md**, and **tasks.md** for completeness against criteria.
  - Git backup: commit created containing the control files.
- **Sign-off:** Pending completion and verification.

- When completing a task, record executed tests (commands and outcomes), attach evidence links, and add agent sign-off with timestamp.

### Updating Tasks
- Add new tasks with clear owners, timestamps, microgoals, and explicit tests.
- When completing a task, record executed tests (commands and outcomes), attach evidence links, and add agent sign-off with timestamp.
- Maintain chronological integrity. Completed tasks should be marked as such and can be moved to an archive file periodically. Use git history for full traceability of all changes.
