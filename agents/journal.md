**Agent:** AI Agent Framework Initializer  
**Action Type:** PROJECT_INITIALIZATION  
**Task ID:** N/A

### Context
Initializing AI agent operation framework for kingdom-monorepo. Creating comprehensive documentation structure for agent operations including rules, task management, journaling, and inter-agent communication protocols.

### Reasoning

   - File management and permissions
   - Task management structure and workflow
   - Logging and journaling requirements
   - Inter-agent communication protocols
   - Testing requirements and evidence
   - Connection and external system guidelines

**Timestamp:** 2025-11-19T19:25:00Z  
**Agent:** AI Agent Framework Initializer  
**Action Type:** TASK_UPDATE  
**Task ID:** Framework-Setup

### Context
Continuing setup of agent operation framework. Core rules and control documents completed. Moving to task and project tracking documents.

### Reasoning
Tasks.md requires careful structure to ensure:
- Each task has clear acceptance criteria
- Microgoals are measurable and testable
- Test evidence is documented
- Agent sign-offs are tracked with timestamps
- Tasks are comprehensive, repeatable, and well-formed

Project documentation (srs.md, features.md, project_summary.md) needs to establish the strategic/tactical hierarchy as described in problem statement:
- srs.md and features.md = "balance sheet" (where we want to be)
- tasks.md and project_summary.md = "income statement" (how we get there)

### Action Taken
Preparing to create remaining documentation files with proper structure and templates.

### Outcome
Clear plan for remaining deliverables established.

### Next Steps
Create tasks.md, project_summary.md, srs.md, and features.md files.
